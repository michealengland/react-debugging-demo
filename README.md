# React Debugging Demo

Hello! Welcome to our React Debugging Demo. We hope this course serves useful.

## Installation

- Clone [here](https://github.com/michealengland/react-debugging-demo)
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

## Getting Started

We Recommend starting with "Paragraph", and working your way across.

For a few of the problems, there are multiple solutions. Do your best, and if
you're ever stuck, don't forget about `debugger`. Also, make sure you check the
console for any hints.

The only folders you will need to work in are:

- the entire "examples" directory
- src/components/Dashboard.js

## External Debugging Resources

- [Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)
- Safari does not have a debugging tools extension and must use the [react-devtools package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-devtools)
