# React Debugging Demo

Hello! Welcome to our React Debugging Demo. We hope this course serves useful.

# Installation

- Clone [here](https://github.com/michealengland/react-debugging-demo)
- `yarn install`
- `yarn run start`
- open Localhost

# Getting Started

We Recommend starting with "Paragraph", and working your way across.

For a few of the problems, there are multiple solutions. Do your best, and if
you're ever stuck, don't forget about `debugger`. Also, make sure you check the
console for any hints.

The only folders you will need to work in are:

- the entire "examples" directory
- src/components/Dashboard.js
